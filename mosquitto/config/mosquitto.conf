# Mosquitto MQTT Broker Configuration
# For distributed-auth relay channel

# Network configuration
# TLS is enabled by default - unencrypted listener is disabled for security
# Uncomment the following only if you need unencrypted access (NOT recommended):
# listener 1883 0.0.0.0
# allow_anonymous true

# TLS/SSL Configuration (ENABLED BY DEFAULT)
# TLS listener on port 8883 (standard MQTT over TLS port)
listener 8883 0.0.0.0
protocol mqtt

# Self-signed certificates (default configuration - no domain registration required)
# REQUIRED: Before starting mosquitto, you MUST generate certificates:
#   Run the configuration validator and certificate generator script:
#     ./process_config.sh
# 
# The script will:
#   - Check for required tools (openssl)
#   - Create certificate directory if needed
#   - Generate CA and server certificates
#   - Validate all generated certificates
#   - Set proper file permissions
#   - Display next steps and instructions
# 
# Then share ca.crt with all nodes in the group (they need it in configs.yaml MQTTTLS.CAFile)
cafile /mosquitto/config/certs/ca.crt
certfile /mosquitto/config/certs/server.crt
keyfile /mosquitto/config/certs/server.key

# TLS version (optional, defaults to all supported)
tls_version tlsv1.2

# Do NOT require client certificates (server-only authentication)
require_certificate false

# Alternative: Let's Encrypt/Certbot certificates (requires domain registration)
# If using Let's Encrypt, comment out the self-signed lines above and uncomment:
# certfile /etc/letsencrypt/live/mqtt.yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem
# keyfile /etc/letsencrypt/live/mqtt.yourdomain.com/privkey.pem
# # Note: No cafile needed - Let's Encrypt CA is in system CA store
# # Also: Replace 'mqtt.yourdomain.com' with your actual domain name

# For mutual TLS (optional, more secure but more complex):
# require_certificate true

# For nodes running the broker: The node itself (distributed-auth) needs minimal changes
#   - Self-signed: Set MQTTTLS.CAFile in configs.yaml to path of ca.crt
#   - Let's Encrypt: No CAFile needed (system CA store used automatically)
#   - Connect using ssl:// or tls:// URL (e.g., ssl://192.168.1.100:8883 or ssl://hostname:8883)
